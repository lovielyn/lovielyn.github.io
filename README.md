## Soooooooo, where do we start?
### I suppose we'll start with my favorites; first, the basics.
- My favorite color is sage green, emerald green, khaki brown.
- My favorite food is sushi and omurice.
- My favorite activity to do is reading, writing, shopping, and of course, sleeping.
### Second, the more, I suppose, in depth introduction to me.
- I was born on April 10, 2008 and I am currently 14-years-old as of 2022.
- My zodiac sign is Aries (if you're wondering).
- I am the eldest child of three to a Japanese father and a Filipino mother.
