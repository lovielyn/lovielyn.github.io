- My favorite food is sushi and omurice.
- My favorite activity to do is reading, writing, shopping, and of course, sleeping.
- My favorite song is "The Way I Loved You" by Taylor Swift, and "Popular Monster" by Falling in Reverse.
### Second, the more, I suppose, in depth introduction to me.
- I was born on April 10, 2008 and I am currently 14-years-old as of 2022.
- My zodiac sign is Aries (if you're wondering).
