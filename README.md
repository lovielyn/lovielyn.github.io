## Soooooooo, where do we start?
You probably have an idea to what your story may be; like having a rough outline to what the plot would be, how the story starts, and how it ends. But, whose story are your readers following? Is it yours? Probably not. A made up character? Most likely.

1. Find an inspiration
As an ameteaur writer, I preferably start with making my characters by taking inspiration from people in my life. Because, I don't know if you've heard of this saying, but the best type of characters are usually based from real people or characters that already exist. You could also choos more than one character. And if you are going to base your character from another a character that already exist, make sure to only take inspiration and not completely copy the character and only change its name.
- For example; Anya Forger from "SPYxFAMILY" and Eren Yeager from "Attack on Titan" are the characters I want to take inspiration from.

2. Make a list
- Once you have a character or person in mind, it's now time to make a list. The context of this list is to jot down the characteristics of this person and you could be able to see what you like and don't like.
- Since Anya Forger is the first character I chose, I'm now going to make a list of her traits, attributes, personallity, and basically anything I want to use as inspiration. Then, I'm going to do the same with the second character I chose, Eren Yeager.

3. The character should be balanced
- What I mean from this is that the character shouldn't be inheritely good nor inheritely bad. They should be well balanced with their positive and negative traits. This is to avoid what we call "Mary Sue" or "Gary Sue"; meaning perfect people who, for example, does something terrible and get away with it because they are the main character or because they did it for a reason that isn't really justifiable but every other character dismisses it and moves on.
- For example:
